# Known Pitfalls — Hard-Won Lessons

These are real bugs encountered in real ports. Check for them every time.

## fopen() Macro Collision

`amiport/stdio.h` defines `#define fopen(p, m) amiport_fopen(p, m)`. Inside `file_io.c` (which implements `amiport_fopen`), this causes infinite recursion. **Fix:** `#undef fopen` before the implementation. Same for `fclose`.

## vamos argv Pointer Arithmetic

On vamos, argv entries are NOT contiguous — each is independently allocated. Code that does `argv[argc-1] - argv[0]` will crash. **Fix:** Use explicit `strlen()` iteration.

## pledge/unveil Stubs

OpenBSD code almost always calls `pledge()` and `unveil()`. Stub as macros:
```c
#define pledge(p, e) (0)
#define unveil(p, f) (0)
```
Never shim as functions.

## vsnprintf(NULL, 0, ...) Crash

libnix's `vsnprintf` does NOT support `NULL` as the destination buffer (C99 extension). Calling `vsnprintf(NULL, 0, fmt, ap)` to measure buffer size crashes on 68000 — libnix writes to address zero. **Fix:** Use a probe buffer:
```c
char probe[1024];
int len = vsnprintf(probe, sizeof(probe), fmt, ap);
```
This commonly appears when replacing `vasprintf()`/`asprintf()`. Use `amiport_asprintf()` instead. See crash-patterns.md #5.

## Exit Path Cleanup

AmigaOS has no automatic process memory cleanup with `-noixemul`. Every `exit()` call must free all allocated memory. When porting programs with global allocations (pattern arrays, compiled regex, line buffers), add a cleanup function called before every `exit()`. See grep port for the `cleanup_patterns()` pattern.
